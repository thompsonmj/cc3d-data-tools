totalSimTimeHr,24,,h,Total simulation time.,"8 hours default, in vitro data goes out to 24 hours."
cc3d_iterODE,1,,unitless,Number of iterations per MCS on CC3D model ODEs,Best=5. Default=1. If 5 CC3D will divide the transfer ODE calcs into 5 substeps.
cc3d_mcs2second,1,,g,Simulated second per MCS (s/MCS). Conversion factor for CC3D MCS to simulated time.,If this value is changed the total number of MCS needs to be changed as well. Best=0.5. Default=1.0. If 0.5 then 2 MCS per simulated second.
