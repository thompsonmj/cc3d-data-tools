MATLAB CODE INSTRUCTIONS:

mommpc_main_START_AND_RESULTS: serves as a wrapper for mommpc_main; automatically sets-up and runs control algorithm in different scenarios; also runs results plotting functions.
mommpc_main: initializes/specifies all information necessary to run the control algorithm
mommpc_iterAW: adaptive-weighted multiple-model predictive control algorithm

All other files are called by the aforementioned scripts/functions and do not need to be run independently.
